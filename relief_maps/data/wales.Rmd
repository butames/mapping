# Inspriration 

I have found a way to create beautiful relief maps using QGIS and Blender. A relief map is a three-dimensional representation of a particular geographical area. Relief maps or raised relief maps typically show the terrain (e.g., mountains, water bodies), materialized as a physical artifact. 

The information and steps documented below are the result of the hardwork of Joe W. Davis. You can find a link to their work [here](https://github.com/JoeWDavies/geoblender).

I first came across their work on the r/dataisbeautiful subreddit. It was really gorgeous and I was looking to emulate it and thankfully, they created at tutorial. Which I have reproduced for the country of Ghana below.
